# Form Persistence Improvements

## Overview

This document outlines the improvements made to the form persistence functionality and contact form user experience.

## Enhanced Form Persistence Hook

The `useFormPersistence` hook has been enhanced with the following features:

### New Features

1. **Auto-save and Recovery**
   - Forms are automatically saved to localStorage
   - Data is recovered when the user returns to the form
   - Configurable expiry time for stored data

2. **State Management**
   - Tracks form dirty state
   - Records last saved timestamp
   - Calculates expiry time

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Confirmation dialog when navigating away with unsaved changes
   - Time remaining indicators
   - Manual save functionality

4. **Configuration Options**
   ```typescript
   interface FormPersistenceOptions {
     expiryMinutes?: number;
     saveOnUnload?: boolean;
     confirmOnUnload?: boolean;
     confirmationMessage?: string;
     autoRestore?: boolean;
     onRestore?: (data: FormData) => void;
   }
   ```

### Usage Example

```typescript
const { 
  formData,
  updateFormData,
  resetFormData,
  saveForm,
  isDirty,
  lastSaved,
  expiresAt,
  getTimeRemaining
} = useFormPersistence('form-id', initialValues, {
  expiryMinutes: 60,
  confirmOnUnload: true
});
```

## Improved Contact Form

The contact form has been enhanced with the following features:

### New Features

1. **Real-time Validation Feedback**
   - Visual indicators for valid/invalid fields
   - Character count for message field
   - Immediate feedback as the user types

2. **Form Persistence**
   - Auto-save as the user types
   - Recovery of form data when returning to the page
   - Manual save functionality with "Save Draft" button

3. **User Experience Improvements**
   - Time remaining indicator
   - Last saved timestamp
   - Confirmation when navigating away with unsaved changes
   - Toast notifications for form actions

4. **Accessibility Improvements**
   - Better focus management
   - Improved screen reader support
   - Clear error messages

## Testing

Comprehensive tests have been added for both the form persistence hook and the contact form component:

1. **Hook Tests**
   - Initialization with default values
   - Form data updates
   - Form data reset
   - Event listener setup
   - Manual save functionality

2. **Component Tests**
   - Form rendering
   - Form validation
   - Form submission
   - Error handling
   - UI state management

## Future Improvements

Potential future improvements to consider:

1. **Server-side Persistence**
   - Save drafts to the server for cross-device access
   - User authentication for saved drafts

2. **Enhanced Recovery**
   - Conflict resolution for multiple devices
   - Version history for drafts

3. **Performance Optimizations**
   - Debounce save operations
   - Compression of stored data
   - Cleanup of expired data

4. **Analytics**
   - Track form abandonment rates
   - Analyze common validation errors
   - Measure time spent on forms
