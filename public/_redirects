# Redirects for Cloudflare Pages
# Next.js generates separate HTML files for each page, so we don't need to redirect to index.html
# These routes should be handled by their respective HTML files

# Assets should be served directly
/_next/*            /_next/:splat  200
/images/*           /images/:splat 200

# Fallback for client-side routing (only needed for dynamic routes)
/*                  /index.html    404
