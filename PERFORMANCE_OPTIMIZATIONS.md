# Performance Optimizations

## Overview

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented across the website to improve user experience and reduce resource usage.

## Memoization with React.memo

### Components Memoized

1. **SubmissionRow** (`src/components/admin/submission-row.tsx`)
   - Prevents unnecessary re-renders of table rows when other parts of the dashboard change
   - Improves performance when scrolling through large lists of submissions

2. **StatsCard** (`src/components/admin/stats-card.tsx`)
   - Prevents re-renders of statistics cards when unrelated state changes
   - Particularly useful when the dashboard is refreshed or filtered

3. **Pagination** (`src/components/admin/pagination.tsx`)
   - Prevents re-renders of pagination controls when only the table data changes
   - Improves performance when navigating between pages

4. **PageSizeSelector** (`src/components/admin/page-size-selector.tsx`)
   - Prevents re-renders when changing other aspects of the dashboard
   - Maintains consistent performance regardless of data size

5. **SearchForm** (`src/components/admin/search-form.tsx`)
   - Prevents re-renders of the search form when table data or pagination changes
   - Improves responsiveness during typing and filtering

## useCallback for Event Handlers

The following event handlers have been optimized with useCallback:

1. **fetchSubmissions**
   - Memoized to prevent unnecessary re-creation on each render
   - Dependencies: currentPage, pageSize, sortField, sortDirection, searchQuery

2. **fetchAllSubmissionsForStats**
   - Memoized to prevent unnecessary re-creation on each render
   - No dependencies as it doesn't rely on changing state

3. **handleSort**
   - Memoized to prevent unnecessary re-creation on each render
   - Dependencies: sortField, sortDirection, updateFormData

4. **handleSearch**
   - Memoized to prevent unnecessary re-creation on each render
   - Dependencies: updateFormData, fetchSubmissions, toast

5. **handleSearchInputChange**
   - Memoized to prevent unnecessary re-creation on each render
   - Dependencies: updateFormData

6. **handlePageSizeChange**
   - Memoized to prevent unnecessary re-creation on each render
   - Dependencies: updateFormData, toast

7. **handleResetSearch**
   - Memoized to prevent unnecessary re-creation on each render
   - Dependencies: resetFormData, fetchSubmissions, toast

8. **handleViewSubmission**
   - Memoized to prevent unnecessary re-creation on each render
   - No dependencies as it doesn't rely on changing state

9. **handleDeleteSubmission**
   - Memoized to prevent unnecessary re-creation on each render
   - Dependencies: toast, selectedSubmission, fetchSubmissions, fetchAllSubmissionsForStats, setError

10. **formatDate**
    - Memoized to prevent unnecessary re-creation on each render
    - No dependencies as it's a pure function

11. **handleExportCSV**
    - Memoized to prevent unnecessary re-creation on each render
    - Dependencies: submissions, toast

## useMemo for Computed Values

1. **Statistics Calculations**
   - Memoized calculations for today's, this week's, and this month's submissions
   - Dependencies: allSubmissions
   - Prevents recalculation when unrelated state changes

## Optimized useEffect Dependencies

1. **Data Fetching**
   - Updated useEffect dependencies to use memoized functions
   - Prevents unnecessary re-fetching when unrelated state changes

## Component Splitting

The dashboard has been split into smaller, focused components:

1. **SubmissionRow**: Handles rendering of a single row in the submissions table
2. **StatsCard**: Handles rendering of a single statistics card
3. **Pagination**: Handles rendering of pagination controls
4. **PageSizeSelector**: Handles rendering of the page size selector
5. **SearchForm**: Handles rendering of the search form

This splitting improves:
- Code maintainability
- Performance through targeted re-renders
- Reusability of components across the application

## Testing

All optimizations have been tested to ensure they don't break existing functionality:

1. **Unit Tests**
   - Tests for the admin dashboard components
   - Tests for form persistence functionality

2. **Integration Tests**
   - Tests for the interaction between components

## Future Optimizations

1. **Virtualized Lists**
   - Implement virtualization for large data sets to only render visible rows

2. **Code Splitting**
   - Implement dynamic imports for less frequently used components

3. **Service Worker**
   - Implement a service worker for caching and offline support

4. **Image Optimization**
   - Further optimize images with next-gen formats and lazy loading

5. **Server-Side Rendering**
   - Implement server-side rendering for initial page load performance
