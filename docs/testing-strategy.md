# Comprehensive Unit Testing Strategy

## Introduction

This document outlines the strategy for implementing comprehensive unit tests for all components and utility functions in the portfolio website (task #30).

## Testing Stack

- Jest as the test runner
- React Testing Library for testing React components
- Jest mocks for isolation

## Current Status & Challenges

We've encountered configuration issues with the Jest setup for this project. The most common error is "Your test suite must contain at least one test" despite tests being present in the files. This appears to be related to:

1. Babel configuration issues for transpiling TypeScript and JSX
2. Conflicts between multiple Jest configuration files
3. Potential Next.js integration issues with Jest

While we continue to resolve these configuration issues, we've created example test files in `docs/example-tests.js` and `docs/example-component-tests.js` that demonstrate the testing approach and patterns we will implement once the configuration is fixed.

## Test Types and Coverage

### 1. Component Tests

| Component Type | Test Scope | Example Tests |
|----------------|------------|--------------|
| UI Components | Rendering, user interactions, props | Button, Card, Input, etc. |
| Layout Components | Rendering, responsive behavior | Header, Footer, Layout |
| Feature Components | Business logic, state management | ContactForm, ProjectList |

### 2. Utility Function Tests

| Utility Type | Test Scope | Examples |
|--------------|------------|----------|
| Pure Functions | Input/output validation | `cn()` in utils.ts |
| Helper Functions | Edge cases, error handling | formatUserErrorMessage() |
| Business Logic | Complex logic validation | detectSpam() |

### 3. Hook Tests

| Hook Type | Test Scope | Examples |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| State Hooks | State changes, side effects | useContactForm |
| Effect Hooks | Lifecycle, dependencies | usePerformanceMonitor |

## Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Core Testing Infrastructure

1. Fix Jest configuration issues:
   - Ensure proper Babel setup for TypeScript and JSX
   - Resolve conflicts between multiple config files
   - Set up proper module mocking for Next.js components

2. Create testing utilities for common operations:
   - Component rendering helpers
   - Mock implementations for common dependencies (Next.js components, etc.)

3. Establish testing patterns and templates:
   - Basic component test structure
   - Utility function test structure
   - Mock data and fixtures

### Phase 2: Utility Function Tests

1. Test core utility functions in lib/ directory:
   - utils.ts: cn() function
   - error-handler.ts: error handling functions
   - spam-detector.ts: spam detection logic
   - rate-limiter.ts: rate limiting functionality
   - logger.ts: logging functionality

   See `docs/example-tests.js` for examples of how these will be tested.

### Phase 3: Component Tests

1. UI Components in components/ui/:
   - button.tsx
   - input.tsx
   - textarea.tsx
   - card.tsx
   - motion-wrapper.tsx
   - lazy-load.tsx

2. Layout Components:
   - header.tsx
   - footer.tsx
   - theme-provider.tsx

3. Feature Components:
   - project-card.tsx
   - contact-form.tsx

   See `docs/example-component-tests.js` for examples of how these will be tested.

### Phase 4: Integration Tests

1. Critical user flows:
   - Contact form submission
   - Theme switching
   - Navigation

## Testing Guidelines

1. **Test Isolation**: Each test should be independent of others
2. **Mock External Dependencies**: APIs, services, and complex components should be mocked
3. **Test Behavior, Not Implementation**: Focus on what the component does, not how it does it
4. **Coverage Goals**: Aim for at least 80% code coverage for utility functions and critical components

## Example Test Files

See the example test files in the docs directory:
- `docs/example-tests.js` - Examples for utility functions
- `docs/example-component-tests.js` - Examples for React components

These contain mock implementations that demonstrate how we will test the actual components once the configuration issues are resolved.

## Next Steps

1. Fix the Jest configuration issues:
   - Investigate the "Your test suite must contain at least one test" error
   - Ensure Babel is properly configured for JSX and TypeScript
   - Consider using a different approach (like creating a new test directory with minimal configuration)

2. Implement a simple proof-of-concept test that works with the current setup

3. Start implementing tests according to the phases outlined above, beginning with utility functions

4. Set up continuous integration to run tests on each commit
