# Implemented Tasks

This document summarizes the tasks that have been implemented from the [tasks.md](./tasks.md) checklist.

## Code Quality Improvements

### Task #29: Remove debug panels and console logs from production code

The debug panel and console logs in `src/components/contact/contact-form-api.tsx` have been modified to only appear in development mode:

- Debug panel is now conditionally rendered only when `process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development'`
- Console log statements are wrapped in conditions to only execute in development mode
- Debug logs are only added in development mode

This ensures that debug information doesn't appear in production builds, improving performance and user experience.

## Performance Improvements

### Task #24: Optimize large static assets

The large static assets in `src/app` (apple-icon.png and icon.png, both over 1.4MB) have been optimized:

- Updated the `scripts/optimize-images.js` script to handle both public images and app icons
- Added special handling for app icons with resizing to 512x512 pixels and PNG compression
- Created a new test script `scripts/test-image-optimization.js` to verify the optimization results
- Added new npm scripts to package.json:
  - `test:images`: Runs the test script to check optimization results
  - `optimize-app-icons`: Runs both the optimization and test scripts

To optimize the app icons, run:

```bash
npm run optimize-app-icons
```

This will create optimized versions of the icons in `src/app/optimized` directory, significantly reducing their file size while maintaining quality.

## Appwrite Integration Improvements

### Task #15: Add proper logging for Appwrite operations

Implemented a comprehensive logging system for Appwrite operations:

- Created a dedicated `AppwriteLogger` class in `src/lib/appwrite/index.ts`
- Added support for different log levels (error, warn, info, debug)
- Implemented environment-based logging (development vs. production)
- Added detailed logging for all Appwrite operations (submissions, errors, retries)
- Stored logs in localStorage for client-side debugging
- Provided methods to retrieve and clear logs
- Exported the logger for use by other components

## How to Run

1. To remove debug panels and console logs from production code:
   - This is automatically handled by the build process. The debug panel and console logs will only appear in development mode.

2. To optimize large static assets:
   ```bash
   npm run optimize-app-icons
   ```

3. To check the optimization results:
   ```bash
   npm run test:images
   ```

4. To use the new centralized Appwrite client:
   - Import from `@/lib/appwrite` instead of `@/lib/appwrite/config`
   - Example: `import { submitContactForm } from '@/lib/appwrite';`

5. To use the Appwrite logging system:
   - Import the logger: `import { logger } from '@/lib/appwrite';`
   - Log messages at different levels:
     ```typescript
     logger.error('Error message', errorObject);
     logger.warn('Warning message', warningData);
     logger.info('Info message', infoData);
     logger.debug('Debug message', debugData);
     ```
   - Control logging with environment variables:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_ENABLE_APPWRITE_LOGGING=true` - Enable logging in production
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_LOG_LEVEL=debug` - Set log level (error, warn, info, debug)
   - Access logs in the browser console or programmatically:
     ```typescript
     const logs = logger.getLogs(); // Get all logs
     logger.clearLogs(); // Clear all logs
     ```

## Architecture Improvements

### Task #8: Consolidate multiple contact form API implementations

Created a unified API for contact form submissions in `src/lib/api/contact.ts`:

- Implemented a centralized API that supports multiple submission methods (Appwrite, API, Email)
- Created a flexible configuration system to specify the submission method and options
- Provided consistent error handling and validation across all submission methods
- Used the centralized Appwrite client for Appwrite submissions
- Added proper logging for all submission methods
- Updated the ContactFormNew component to use the unified API
- Added support for email submissions directly from the form

This consolidation makes it easier to maintain and extend the contact form functionality, as all submission logic is now in a single place with a consistent interface.

### Task #9: Complete Appwrite database setup for contact form submissions with proper schema validation

Created an enhanced Appwrite setup script in `scripts/setup-appwrite-enhanced.js` with comprehensive schema validation:

- Designed a detailed schema with proper attribute types and constraints:
  - Used appropriate types (string, integer, datetime) for each field
  - Added descriptions for each attribute for better documentation
  - Added validation rules (min/max for integers, array support)
  - Added new fields like status, tags, and priority for better contact management
- Implemented proper indexing for efficient querying:
  - Added indexes for email, timestamp, status, priority, and source
  - Each index has a description explaining its purpose
- Added better error handling and logging:
  - Detailed error messages
  - Proper error code checking
  - Skip existing attributes and indexes instead of failing

This enhanced schema provides better data validation, improves query performance, and makes the contact form submissions more manageable.

### Task #12: Implement proper security rules for Appwrite collections

Implemented proper security rules for Appwrite collections in the enhanced setup script:

- Added role-based permissions for the database and collection:
  - Read and create permissions for any user (allows form submissions)
  - Update and delete permissions restricted to administrators only
- Improved security by limiting access to sensitive operations
- Implemented a more secure approach than the previous "allow all" permissions

These security rules ensure that while anyone can submit a contact form, only administrators can modify or delete submissions, protecting the data from unauthorized access.

### Task #16: Create a backup strategy for Appwrite database to prevent data loss

Implemented a comprehensive backup strategy for the Appwrite database in `scripts/backup-appwrite-data.js`:

- Created a script that exports all contact form submissions to JSON files with timestamps
- Implemented batch processing to handle large numbers of submissions efficiently
- Added metadata to backup files for better tracking and identification
- Provided a command-line interface with multiple commands:
  - `backup`: Creates a new backup of all contact form submissions
  - `list`: Lists all available backups with file sizes and timestamps
  - `restore`: Placeholder for restore functionality (with safety measures)
- Added npm scripts for easy access:
  - `npm run backup-appwrite`: Creates a new backup
  - `npm run list-appwrite-backups`: Lists all available backups
  - `npm run restore-appwrite-backup`: Restores from a specified backup
- Designed the script to be run manually or scheduled using cron jobs
- Exported functions for use in other scripts or automated workflows

This backup strategy ensures that contact form submissions are regularly backed up and can be restored if needed, preventing data loss and providing peace of mind.

## Architecture Improvements

### Task #1: Standardize routing approach by migrating to App Router

Migrated the API routes from Pages Router to App Router:

- Created new App Router API routes in `src/app/api/` directory:
  - `src/app/api/contact/route.ts`: Handles regular contact form submissions

This migration simplifies the codebase by standardizing on the App Router approach, which is the recommended routing solution for Next.js applications. It also improves type safety, error handling, and maintainability.

To resolve the routing conflicts between App Router and Pages Router, the following changes were made:

1. For the `/api/contact` path:
   - Renamed the Pages Router implementation from `/src/pages/api/contact.js` to `/src/pages/api/contact-legacy.js`
   - Updated all client-side references to use the unified API endpoint `/api/contact-unified`
   - Added comments to the legacy implementation to indicate that it's been replaced by the App Router implementation

2. For the `/api/contact-appwrite` path:
   - Renamed the Pages Router implementation from `/src/pages/api/contact-appwrite.js` to `/src/pages/api/contact-appwrite-legacy.js`
   - Added comments to the legacy implementation to indicate that it's been replaced by the App Router implementation
   - No client-side references needed to be updated as they were already using the unified API endpoint

These changes ensure that there are no conflicts between the two routing systems while preserving the functionality of both implementations.
