# Applying the Performance Optimizations

To apply the performance optimizations we've implemented, follow these steps:

1. Replace the contents of `src/app/page.tsx` with the contents of `src/app/page-updated.tsx`.

```bash
# From your project root, you can use:
cp src/app/page-updated.tsx src/app/page.tsx
```

2. Build and test the website to ensure the optimizations work correctly:

```bash
npm run build
npm run start
```

## Testing the Optimizations

### Image Optimization

To verify that the image optimization is working:

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to the Network tab
3. Reload the page
4. Check the image requests - you should see optimized image formats and sizes
5. Observe that the profile image loads with high priority

### Lazy Loading

To verify that lazy loading is working:

1. Open Chrome DevTools (F12)
2. Go to the Performance tab
3. Start a performance recording
4. Reload the page and slowly scroll down
5. Stop the recording
6. You should observe that below-the-fold content is only loaded as you scroll near it
7. The initial page load should be faster as it only loads the Hero section immediately

## Expected Results

- The initial page load should be faster
- Core Web Vitals (LCP, FID, CLS) should improve
- The profile image should load quickly and clearly
- Below-the-fold sections should load just before they become visible

If you encounter any issues, check the browser console for errors and ensure that all components are properly imported.
