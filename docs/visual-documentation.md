## Project Architecture

The following diagram illustrates the high-level architecture of the Jacob Barkin Portfolio website:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Frontend"
        A[Next.js App] --> B[Pages]
        A --> C[Components]
        A --> D[Hooks]
        A --> E[Utilities]
    end
    
    subgraph "Backend"
        F[Appwrite] --> G[Database]
        F --> H[Functions]
        F --> I[Authentication]
    end
    
    subgraph "Deployment"
        J[GitHub] --> K[GitHub Actions]
        K --> L[Cloudflare Pages]
    end
    
    A <--> F
    K --> F
```

### Key Components

- **Frontend**: Next.js application with React components, custom hooks, and utilities
- **Backend**: Appwrite services for database, functions, and authentication
- **Deployment**: GitHub repository with GitHub Actions for CI/CD, deploying to Cloudflare Pages

## Component Hierarchy

The following diagram shows the component hierarchy for the main pages of the website:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Root Layout"
        A[RootLayout] --> B[ThemeProvider]
        B --> C[Header]
        B --> D[Main Content]
        B --> E[Footer]
    end
    
    subgraph "Home Page"
        D --> F[HomePage]
        F --> G[HeroSection]
        F --> H[FeaturedProjects]
        F --> I[AboutSection]
        F --> J[ContactCTA]
    end
    
    subgraph "Projects Page"
        D --> K[ProjectsPage]
        K --> L[PageHero]
        K --> M[FeaturedProjectsGrid]
        K --> N[GithubProjects]
    end
    
    subgraph "Contact Page"
        D --> O[ContactPage]
        O --> P[PageHero]
        O --> Q[ContactForm]
        Q --> R[FormStatus]
        Q --> S[FormPersistenceIndicator]
    end
    
    subgraph "Admin Dashboard"
        D --> T[AdminDashboard]
        T --> U[AdminLogin]
        T --> V[SubmissionsList]
        V --> W[SubmissionDetails]
    end
```

## Data Flow

The following diagram illustrates the data flow for the contact form submission process:

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant User
    participant ContactForm
    participant FormPersistence
    participant AppwriteClient
    participant AppwriteFunction
    participant EmailService
    
    User->>ContactForm: Fill form
    ContactForm->>FormPersistence: Save form data
    FormPersistence->>localStorage: Store data
    
    User->>ContactForm: Submit form
    ContactForm->>AppwriteClient: Send submission
    AppwriteClient->>Appwrite: Create document
    
    Appwrite->>AppwriteFunction: Trigger function
    AppwriteFunction->>EmailService: Send email notification
    EmailService->>Admin: Deliver email
    
    Appwrite-->>AppwriteClient: Confirm submission
    AppwriteClient-->>ContactForm: Success response
    ContactForm-->>User: Show success message
    ContactForm->>FormPersistence: Clear form data
    FormPersistence->>localStorage: Remove stored data
```

## Appwrite Integration

The following diagram shows how the website integrates with Appwrite services:

```mermaid
graph TD
    subgraph "Jacob Barkin Website"
        A[Next.js App] --> B[Appwrite Client]
        B --> C[Database Service]
        B --> D[Functions Service]
        B --> E[Authentication Service]
    end
    
    subgraph "Appwrite Cloud"
        F[Appwrite API] --> G[Contact Form Database]
        F --> H[Email Notification Function]
        F --> I[Admin Authentication]
    end
    
    C <--> F
    D <--> F
    E <--> F
    
    H --> J[Email Service]
    J --> K[Admin Email]
```

### Key Integration Points

1. **Contact Form**:
   - Submissions stored in Appwrite database
   - Email notifications sent via Appwrite function

2. **Admin Dashboard**:
   - Authentication via Appwrite
   - Submission data retrieved from Appwrite database

3. **API Integration**:
   - Client-side SDK for public features
   - Server-side API for admin features

## Deployment Workflow

The following diagram illustrates the CI/CD workflow for deploying the website:

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Developer] -->|Push changes| B[GitHub Repository]
    B -->|Trigger workflow| C[GitHub Actions]
    
    subgraph "GitHub Actions Workflow"
        C --> D[Install dependencies]
        D --> E[Run tests]
        E --> F[Lint code]
        F --> G[Build site]
        G --> H[Deploy to Cloudflare]
    end
    
    H -->|Deploy site| I[Cloudflare Pages]
    H -->|Deploy function| J[Appwrite Functions]
    
    I -->|Serve website| K[End Users]
    J -->|Process submissions| L[Email Notifications]
```

### Deployment Steps

1. **Code Push**: Developer pushes changes to GitHub
2. **CI/CD Trigger**: GitHub Actions workflow is triggered
3. **Build Process**: Dependencies installed, tests run, site built
4. **Deployment**: Site deployed to Cloudflare Pages, functions to Appwrite
5. **Availability**: Website available to end users
