# Performance Optimizations

This document outlines the performance optimizations implemented in the portfolio website, focusing on improving loading times, reducing bundle size, and enhancing user experience.

## Implemented Optimizations

### Image Optimization (Task #17)

- **Next.js Image Component**: Replaced standard HTML `<img>` tags with Next.js `<Image>` component across the site.
- **Responsive Images**: Added proper `sizes` attributes to ensure correct image sizing across device widths.
- **Image Quality Control**: Set appropriate quality levels (around 90%) for important images while using default quality for others.
- **Priority Loading**: Critical images above the fold are marked with `priority={true}` for early loading.
- **Lazy Loading**: Images below the fold use the default lazy loading behavior.
- **Background Images**: Created an `OptimizedBackgroundImage` component that leverages Next.js Image for background images.

```tsx
<ResponsiveImage
  src="/images/example.jpg"
  alt="Example image"
  fill
  className="object-cover"
  sizes="(max-width: 640px) 280px, (max-width: 768px) 384px, 400px"
  priority={true}
  quality={90}
/>
```

### Lazy Loading Components (Task #18)

- **Below-the-fold Content**: Implemented lazy loading for components not needed on initial page load.
- **LazyLoad Component**: Created a custom `LazyLoad` component that defers rendering of content until it's closer to the viewport.
- **Application**: Applied to sections like Projects, Education, Skills, and Contact Form that typically appear below the fold.

```tsx
<LazyLoad className="bg-muted/30">
  <section className="py-10 sm:py-14 md:py-20">
    {/* Section content */}
  </section>
</LazyLoad>
```

### Code Splitting (Task #19)

- **Leveraged Next.js Code Splitting**: Used Next.js built-in code splitting capabilities.
- **Dynamic Imports**: Implemented dynamic imports for heavy components.

```tsx
const HeavyComponent = dynamic(() => import('../components/heavy-component'), {
  loading: () => <p>Loading...</p>,
  ssr: false
});
```

### Service Worker (Task #20)

- **Offline Support**: Implemented a service worker for offline support and caching.
- **Cache Strategy**: Used a "cache first, network fallback" strategy for static assets.
- **PWA Support**: Added Web App Manifest for Progressive Web App functionality.

### Third-party Library Optimization (Task #21)

- **Removed Unused Dependencies**: Eliminated unused packages like `date-fns` and `tw-animate-css`.
- **Optimized React Icons**: Created strategy for importing only specific icons needed.
- **Lazy-loaded Framer Motion**: Implemented dynamic loading of framer-motion components to reduce initial bundle size.

```tsx
// Optimized icon imports
import { FaGithub } from 'react-icons/fa';

// Instead of
import { FaGithub, FaTwitter, /* many more */ } from 'react-icons/fa';
```

### Font Loading Strategy (Task #22)

- **Font Display Swap**: Added `display: "swap"` to the font configuration to prevent font blocking.
- **Preconnect**: Added preconnect hints to Google Fonts domains for faster font loading.

```tsx
const inter = Inter({
  subsets: ["latin"],
  variable: "--font-inter",
  display: "swap",
});
```

### Resource Hints (Task #23)

- **Preconnect**: Added preconnect hints for critical domains like Google Fonts.
- **Preload**: Added preload hints for critical resources like hero images.

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com" />
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossOrigin="anonymous" />
<link rel="preload" href="/images/mountains-bg.jpg" as="image" type="image/jpeg" />
```

### Caching Strategies (Tasks #25, #27)

- **Headers Configuration**: Created proper cache headers for different types of assets.
- **Long-term Caching**: Set up immutable caching for static assets like images with long max-age.
- **Short-term Caching**: Used shorter cache times with revalidation for HTML and dynamic content.

```
# Cache control for static assets
/images/*
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=31536000, immutable
  
# JavaScript and CSS files
/*.js
  Cache-Control: public, max-age=604800, stale-while-revalidate=86400
```

### Cloudflare Pages Build Optimization (Task #26)

- **Wrangler Configuration**: Added a `wrangler.toml` file with optimized build settings.
- **Node Bundler**: Set `node_bundler = "esbuild"` for faster builds.
- **Dependency Caching**: Configured dependency caching with `[cache.build] enabled = true`.
- **Content Compression**: Enabled CSS, JS, HTML, and image compression.
- **Enhanced Next.js Config**: Created an optimized Next.js configuration file.

```toml
# Cache dependencies to speed up builds
[build.environment]
NPM_FLAGS = "--no-audit --no-fund"
NODE_ENV = "production"

# Add content compression
[build.processing]
skip_processing = false

[build.processing.css]
bundle = true
minify = true

[build.processing.js]
bundle = true
minify = true
```

### Performance Monitoring (Task #28)

- **Automated Monitoring**: Implemented a script to collect performance metrics.
- **Lighthouse Integration**: Monitors core web vitals and other Lighthouse metrics.
- **GitHub Actions**: Set up automated monitoring after deployments and on a schedule.
- **Performance Reports**: Generates HTML reports with recommendations for improvements.
- **Alert System**: Configured alerts when performance drops below thresholds.

```javascript
// Collect Lighthouse metrics for all pages
async function collectLighthouseMetrics(url) {
  // Implementation to collect performance scores, LCP, CLS, FID, etc.
}

// Check performance against thresholds
if (avgPerformance < 90) {
  console.log(`❌ Performance score (${Math.round(avgPerformance)}%) is below threshold.`);
}
```

## Performance Measurement

To evaluate the impact of these optimizations, use the following tools:

1. **Lighthouse**: Run Lighthouse audits before and after optimizations to measure performance improvements.
2. **WebPageTest**: Analyze load times and waterfall charts.
3. **Chrome DevTools**: Use the Performance and Network tabs to analyze load times.

## Additional Optimizations To Consider

- **Bundle Analysis**: Use tools like `@next/bundle-analyzer` to identify and address large dependencies.
- **Edge Caching**: Implement edge caching with Cloudflare Pages for better global performance.
- **Critical CSS**: Extract and inline critical CSS for even faster first contentful paint.
- **Partial Hydration**: Consider using frameworks or techniques that support partial hydration to reduce JavaScript overhead.

## Maintenance

To maintain these performance optimizations over time:

1. **Regular Audits**: Run performance audits regularly to catch regressions.
2. **Dependencies Monitoring**: Keep dependencies updated and minimal.
3. **Image Optimization Pipeline**: Ensure new images follow the optimization guidelines.
4. **Documentation**: Keep this document updated with new optimizations and best practices.
