# Image Optimization Implementation - Part 2

This document describes the continued implementation of Task #17: Image Optimization using Next.js Image component throughout the site.

## Updated Code

### Fix Profile Image (Home Page)

In the home page (`src/app/page.tsx`), replace the following code:

```tsx
<Image
  src="/images/Jacob City.png"
  alt="Jacob Barkin"
  fill
  className="object-cover"
/>
```

with this optimized version using the ResponsiveImage component:

```tsx
<ResponsiveImage
  src="/images/Jacob City.png"
  alt="Jacob Barkin" 
  className="object-cover"
  width={400}
  height={400}
  priority={true}
  quality={90}
  sizes="(max-width: 640px) 192px, (max-width: 768px) 224px, (max-width: 1024px) 256px, 288px"
/>
```

### Fix Optimization Issues in Projects Page

In the projects page (`src/app/projects/page.tsx`), fix the type errors by updating the FeaturedProject interface and project data:

1. Update the FeaturedProject interface:
```tsx
interface FeaturedProject {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  link: string;
  image?: string;
  icon?: React.ReactNode;
  gradient: string;
  tags: string[];
  github?: string | null;
}
```

2. Update all project data to use `undefined` instead of `null` for the image property:
```tsx
const projects = [
  {
    id: "ask-the-kidz",
    title: "Ask The Kidz",
    description: "...",
    image: undefined,
    // ... rest of properties
  },
  // Update other projects
];
```

## Next Steps

1. Replace more background images throughout the site with `OptimizedBackgroundImage`
2. Replace standard `Image` tags with `ResponsiveImage` component throughout the site
3. Add proper priority flags to above-the-fold images
4. Add appropriate `sizes` attribute to images based on their display size
5. Consider implementing a lazy-loaded image grid for project galleries
6. Add blur placeholders for key images to improve perceived loading performance

## Benefits

- Improved Core Web Vitals scores through optimized image loading
- Reduced bandwidth usage by serving appropriately sized images
- Better mobile experience through responsive images
- Improved accessibility with proper alt text
- Better SEO through optimized image loading
