# Task #6: Implement Firebase Firestore for Contact Form Submissions

This task focused on integrating Firebase Firestore as the database solution for contact form submissions, ensuring that all submissions are stored securely and can be efficiently retrieved and managed. This replaces the previous Appwrite database integration.

## Implementation Details

### 1. Firebase Firestore Integration

Firebase Firestore was chosen for its scalability, real-time capabilities, and seamless integration with other Firebase services like Cloud Functions and Authentication. The implementation includes:

-   Defining a `contact-submissions` collection for storing form data.
-   Utilizing Firebase server timestamps for accurate record-keeping.
-   Implementing security rules to protect the data.
-   Leveraging Firebase Cloud Functions for backend logic related to submissions (e.g., sending email notifications).

### 2. Database Schema (`contact-submissions` Collection)

The contact form submissions are stored as documents in the `contact-submissions` collection. A typical document includes fields such as:

| Attribute   | Type              | Description                                     |
|-------------|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `name`      | string            | Submitter's name                                |
| `email`     | string            | Submitter's email                               |
| `subject`   | string            | Subject of the message                          |
| `message`   | string            | Message content                                 |
| `timestamp` | Firestore Timestamp| Submission timestamp (server-generated)         |
| `status`    | string            | Status (e.g., "unread", "read", "replied")      |
| `userAgent` | string (optional) | Submitter's browser/client information          |
| `source`    | string (optional) | E.g., "website-contact-form-firebase"           |

Refer to `docs/architecture/firebase-integration.md` for more detailed schema information.

### 3. Database Operations (Firebase Services)

A suite of service functions for interacting with Firestore is implemented in `src/lib/firebase/submissionsService.ts`. These functions handle creating, retrieving, updating, and deleting submissions. Examples include:

-   `getSubmissions()`: Retrieves submissions with pagination and filtering.
-   `getSubmissionById()`: Retrieves a single submission by ID.
-   `updateSubmission()`: Updates the status or other fields of a submission.
-   `deleteSubmission()`: Removes a submission.

The `submitContactForm` Firebase Cloud Function (located in `functions/src/index.ts`) handles the initial creation of submission documents.

### 4. Data Validation

-   Client-side validation is performed by the contact form component (`src/components/contact/contact-form-firebase.tsx`) using Zod schemas.
-   The `submitContactForm` Cloud Function also performs basic validation on the incoming data before writing to Firestore.

### 5. Security

-   **Firestore Security Rules**: These rules are defined in the Firebase console to control access to the `contact-submissions` collection. For example, rules ensure that only authenticated admin users can read or modify submissions, while the `submitContactForm` function (acting with server-side privileges or specific permissions) can create new submissions.
-   **Firebase Authentication**: Used to secure the admin dashboard where submissions are viewed and managed.

### 6. Benefits of Migrating to Firebase Firestore

1.  **Scalability and Reliability**: Firestore is a highly scalable and reliable NoSQL database.
2.  **Real-time Updates**: Firestore can provide real-time updates, which can be beneficial for admin dashboards.
3.  **Integrated Ecosystem**: Seamless integration with Firebase Authentication and Cloud Functions simplifies backend development.
4.  **Robust Security Model**: Firebase offers a powerful security rules system.
5.  **Serverless Architecture**: Reduces the need to manage backend infrastructure.

## Next Steps (Post-Migration)

-   Further refine Firestore security rules for granular access control.
-   Implement advanced querying and filtering in the admin dashboard using Firestore capabilities.
-   Explore Firebase extensions for additional functionalities if needed.
-   Set up regular backups for Firestore data through the GCP console or `gcloud` commands.
-   Monitor Firestore usage and performance via the Firebase console.
