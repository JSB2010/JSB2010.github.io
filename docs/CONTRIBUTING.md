## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18.17 or later
- npm or yarn
- Appwrite account (for backend functionality)

### Installation

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/jacobbarkin.com.git
   cd jacobbarkin.com
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up environment variables:
   - Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local`
   - Update the values with your Appwrite credentials

5. Start the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## Development Workflow

1. Create a new branch for your feature or bugfix:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

2. Make your changes and commit them with descriptive commit messages:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your changes"
   ```

3. Push your branch to your fork:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. Create a pull request from your fork to the main repository

## Code Style

This project uses ESLint and Prettier for code formatting and linting. Please ensure your code follows these standards:

- Run linting before committing:
  ```bash
  npm run lint
  ```

- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Follow the existing code structure and naming conventions
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility

## Testing

All new features and bug fixes should include tests:

- Run tests before submitting a pull request:
  ```bash
  npm test
  ```

- Write unit tests for utility functions and components
- Write integration tests for critical user flows
- Aim for high test coverage for critical code paths

## Accessibility

Accessibility is a priority for this project:

- Run accessibility checks before submitting a pull request:
  ```bash
  npm run check-a11y
  ```

- Ensure all components are keyboard navigable
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Provide appropriate ARIA attributes
- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Test with screen readers

## Security

Security is critical for this project:

- Run security checks before submitting a pull request:
  ```bash
  npm run security-scan
  ```

- Never expose API keys or secrets in client-side code
- Implement proper input validation and sanitization
- Follow security best practices for authentication and authorization
- Report security vulnerabilities privately to the project maintainer

## Performance

Performance is important for a good user experience:

- Run performance checks before submitting a pull request:
  ```bash
  npm run analyze-bundle
  ```

- Optimize images and assets
- Use code splitting and lazy loading
- Minimize dependencies
- Follow performance best practices

## Documentation

Good documentation is essential:

- Update documentation for any changes to APIs or components
- Document complex logic with comments
- Update the README.md if necessary
- Add JSDoc comments for functions and components

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure your code passes all tests, linting, and accessibility checks
2. Update documentation as necessary
3. Fill out the pull request template completely
4. Request a review from a maintainer
5. Address any feedback from the review
6. Once approved, your pull request will be merged

## Code of Conduct
