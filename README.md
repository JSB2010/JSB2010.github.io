## 🛠️ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Node.js**: Version 18.17 or later (required for Next.js 15)
- **Package Manager**: npm (8.x) or yarn (1.22.x)
- **Appwrite Account**: Free account at [appwrite.io](https://appwrite.io) for backend functionality
- **Git**: For cloning the repository and version control

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/JSB2010/jacobbarkin.com.git
   cd jacobbarkin.com
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables**:
   - Copy the template to your local environment file:
     ```bash
     cp .env.example .env.local
     ```
   - Open `.env.local` and update the values with your Appwrite credentials:
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_PROJECT_ID`: Your Appwrite project ID
     - `NEXT_PUBLIC_APPWRITE_FUNCTION_ID`: Your Appwrite function ID for email notifications
     - Other variables as needed (see [Environment Configuration](./ENV_CONFIGURATION.md))

4. **Set up Appwrite backend**:
   - This script creates the necessary database, collections, and functions:
     ```bash
     npm run setup-appwrite-complete
     ```
   - If you encounter any issues, see the [Appwrite Setup Troubleshooting](#appwrite-setup-troubleshooting) section

5. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

6. **Open your browser** and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Appwrite Setup Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with the Appwrite setup:

1. Ensure your Appwrite API key has sufficient permissions
2. Check that your project ID and endpoint are correct in `.env.local`
3. Run the setup script with verbose logging:
   ```bash
   NODE_ENV=development DEBUG=appwrite:* npm run setup-appwrite-complete
   ```
4. For manual setup, see the [Appwrite Manual Setup Guide](./docs/architecture/appwrite-integration.md)

## 🧪 Testing

This project uses Jest and React Testing Library for comprehensive testing of components, hooks, and utilities.

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Run tests in watch mode (for development)
npm run test:watch

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run a specific test file
npm test -- path/to/test-file.js

# Run tests matching a specific pattern
npm test -- -t "contact form"
```

### Test Structure

The testing strategy follows a pyramid approach:

1. **Unit Tests**: For individual functions, hooks, and small components
   - Located in `__tests__` directories adjacent to the code being tested
   - Naming convention: `[filename].test.ts(x)`

2. **Component Tests**: For UI components with mocked dependencies
   - Test rendering, user interactions, and state changes
   - Use React Testing Library for DOM testing

3. **Integration Tests**: For critical user flows across components
   - Test form submissions, navigation, and data fetching
   - Use MSW (Mock Service Worker) to mock API responses

4. **Accessibility Tests**: Automated and manual tests for accessibility
   - Run with `npm run check-a11y` or `npm run check-a11y-all`
   - Tests against WCAG 2.1 AA standards

### Custom Hooks Testing

The project includes specialized tests for custom hooks:

- **useFormPersistence**: Tests form data persistence with:
  - Auto-save and recovery functionality
  - Expiry management and cleanup
  - Navigation warnings for unsaved changes
  - Time remaining indicators

- **useAppwrite**: Tests Appwrite client integration with:
  - Authentication flows
  - Database operations
  - Error handling and retries

### Test Utilities

Reusable test utilities are available in `src/lib/test-utils.ts`:

- Custom render functions with providers
- Common test data fixtures
- Mock implementations for complex dependencies

## 🚢 Deployment

### Cloudflare Pages Deployment

This project is configured for deployment to Cloudflare Pages with optimized caching and performance settings:

1. **GitHub Integration**:
   - Push your changes to GitHub
   - The GitHub Actions workflow will automatically build and deploy to Cloudflare Pages
   - See `.github/workflows/cloudflare-pages.yml` for the workflow configuration

2. **Manual Cloudflare Setup**:
   - Log in to the Cloudflare Dashboard
   - Navigate to Pages > Create a project
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Configure the build settings:
     - Build command: `npm run build`
     - Build output directory: `out`
     - Node.js version: 18.x (or later)
   - Add environment variables:
     - Copy all `NEXT_PUBLIC_*` variables from your `.env.local`
     - Add any other required environment variables

3. **Custom Domain Setup**:
   - In Cloudflare Pages, go to your project > Custom domains
   - Add your domain (e.g., `jacobbarkin.com`)
   - Configure DNS settings as instructed by Cloudflare
   - Enable HTTPS with Cloudflare's SSL certificate

4. **Performance Optimizations**:
   - Custom caching rules are defined in `public/_headers`
   - Content Security Policy headers are configured for security
   - Assets are optimized and served with proper cache headers

### Appwrite Functions Deployment

The project includes Appwrite serverless functions for backend operations:

1. **Automated Deployment**:
   ```bash
   npm run setup-appwrite-function
   ```
   This script:
   - Creates or updates the function in your Appwrite project
   - Uploads the function code
   - Sets required environment variables
   - Creates necessary API endpoints

2. **Manual Deployment**:
   - Navigate to the Appwrite Console
   - Go to Functions > Create Function
   - Set the runtime to Node.js 18.0
   - Upload the code from `functions/email-notification-updated`
   - Set the entrypoint to `src/main.js`
   - Configure environment variables:
     - `EMAIL_USER`: Your email address
     - `EMAIL_PASSWORD`: Your app-specific password

3. **Function Configuration**:
   - The function is triggered via HTTP requests from the contact form
   - It sends email notifications for new form submissions
   - It logs activity for monitoring and debugging

### Continuous Deployment

The project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment:

1. **Automatic Deployments**:
   - Pushes to the main branch trigger automatic deployments
   - Pull requests trigger preview deployments

2. **Quality Checks**:
   - Linting and type checking
   - Unit and integration tests
   - Accessibility checks
   - Performance monitoring

3. **Monitoring**:
