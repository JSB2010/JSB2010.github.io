        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="Jacob City.png" alt="Jacob Barkin" class="headshot">
        <p>Born with a rare genetic condition called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/albinism/symptoms-causes/syc-20369184">Albinism</a>, my vision has never been very good. In elementary school, I needed an iPad to see the screen/board, and this need for technology turned into a hobby.</p>
        <h2>Interests</h2>

                <h3>App Development</h3>
                <p>I like creating apps and websites that can help me or others, and learning new languages and styles of programming.</p>

                <h3>Public Transportation</h3>
                <p>Because of my vision, I am unable to drive, so I take public transit as much as possible. I like to do research on our current systems, and how to improve them.</p>
