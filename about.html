        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <img src="Jacob City.png" alt="Jacob Barkin" class="headshot" style="border-radius: 0;">
        <p>Born with a rare genetic condition called <a href="https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/albinism/symptoms-causes/syc-20369184">Albinism</a>, my vision has never been very good. In elementry school I needed an iPad to see the screen/board, and this need for technology turned into a hobby.</p>

                <h3>Technology</h3>
                <p>My passion for technology started when I was young, and I have been learning about it ever since.</p>
                <h3>Punlic Transportation</h3>
                <p>Becuase of my vision, I am unable to drive, so I take public transit as much as possible I like to do research on our current systems, and how to improve them</p>
                <h3>Finance/Economics</h3>
                <p>I was fortunate enought to be able to open an account at <a href="https://yacenter.org">Young Americans Center for Financial Education</a> and since then, I have been an advocate for childhood financial education, and I am now on the Youth Adviosry Board of the center</p>
