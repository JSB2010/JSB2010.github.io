# üìß Email Notification Function for Contact Form

This function sends email notifications when new contact form submissions are received in the Appwrite database.

## üîê Environment Variables

This function requires the following environment variables:

| Variable        | Description                                  |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------|
| EMAIL_USER      | Your Gmail address (e.g., your@gmail.com)    |
| EMAIL_PASSWORD  | Your Gmail app password                      |

**Note:** For Gmail, you need to use an App Password instead of your regular password. You can create one at https://myaccount.google.com/apppasswords

## üöÄ Deployment

1. Navigate to your Appwrite Console
2. Click on Functions in the side menu
3. Select your function

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

## üìù How It Works

1. The function is triggered when a new document is created in the contact-submissions collection
2. It extracts the contact form data from the document
3. It formats an email with the submission details
4. It sends the email using Nodemailer and Gmail SMTP
5. It returns a success or error response

## üîç Troubleshooting

If you're not receiving emails:
- Check the function logs in the Appwrite Console
- Verify your Gmail app password is correct
- Check your spam folder
- Make sure the database event trigger is set up correctly
